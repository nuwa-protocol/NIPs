# NIPs - Nuwa Improvement Proposals

Welcome to the Nuwa Improvement Proposal (NIP) repository. NIPs are the primary way to propose new features, collect community input on issues, and document design decisions for the Nuwa Protocol and its ecosystem.

## Process

The NIP process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features, standards, and protocols to be proposed, debated, and adopted. For details on the NIP process, including how to submit a NIP, please refer to [NIP-0: NIP Process](./NIPs/nip-0.md) and use the [nip-template.md](./nip-template.md) for submissions.

## Current NIPs

Below is a list of current Nuwa Improvement Proposals. Each NIP has a status indicating its current stage in the process (e.g., Draft, Proposed, Accepted, Final, Rejected).
