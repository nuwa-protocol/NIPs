This website hosts the Nuwa Improvement Proposals (NIPs). NIPs serve as the primary method for proposing new features, gathering community feedback on various issues, and documenting the design decisions for the Nuwa Protocol and its associated ecosystem.

The Nuwa Protocol is designed to create a comprehensive and decentralized framework for AI Agents.

For details on the NIP process itself, including how to contribute, please refer to [NIP-0: The NIP Process](/nips/nip-0/).

You can find the source code for all NIPs and contribute to discussions at the [Nuwa Protocol NIPs GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/NIPs).
